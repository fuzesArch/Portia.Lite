Created by Bálint Füzes (MSc. Architect and software developer) Portia is a graph engine designed to solve the persistent challenge of conditionally grouping and validating geometry in Grasshopper. By passing clear, readable Conditions, Rules and Tasks through data streams, it safeguards model integrity and precision.
While directly suited to network-like constructions, Portia establishes the logical abstraction required to automate and accelerate downstream 3D modeling wherever node–edge relationships define the structure.

I am always happy to discuss new development ideas, roadmap suggestions, or specific enterprise customization needs.
